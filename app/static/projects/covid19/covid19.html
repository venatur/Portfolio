    Recursive! My personal space in the great world wide web. I've revised the design time and again, and feel I'm at a
    stage where I'm quite happy with it now!

    This is built using:
    <ul>
        <li>Python Flask</li>
        <li>A lot of Jinja2 and HTML</li>
        <li>Hosted on Heroku, because <code>git push heroku master</code></li>
    </ul>

    <span> I've open sourced all of it, and several people have written to me to use the website as a template for
        their own portfolio!</span>
